# Project Zero

A multi-purpose (mostly recreational) web for my workplace team.
## Getting Started

Official website

<br>
https://project-zero-384ad.web.app/#/

<br>
https://project-zero-384ad.firebaseapp.com/#/

<br>
After you pull the project, run the below command

`flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html`

<br>

## How to contribute

<br>

### 1. Create or choose an existing issue
- Create or choose an existing issue to work on
- Dont touch issue with an `in progress` label, unless it has not been updated for more than 2 weeks
- An issue MUST have a label

### 2. Start working
- Assign yourself to the issue
- Create a branch from `main`
- Branch must be in format `{doc/feature/bug/tech/enhance}/{issue_number}/{short_description}`
Ex: `doc/9/update_readme_and_license`
- If branch does not follow format, CI will fail


### 3. Create a pull request
- Once you have finished coding, push to your branch in remote
- Create a pull request to `main`, remember to fill the template
- The CI will automatically run

### 4. Review
- Ping reviewer
- Resolves conversations (if any)

### 5. Done
- The reviewer will rebase and merge your ticket (if no major changes)


### 6. Permissions:
- Ask repo owner for permission to access Firebase

## Project structure
